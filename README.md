21. There is a singly linked list given to you. Find if the Loop exists in the Linked list or not and also find the point where the loop is happening if the loop is present.<br/>
22. Reverse the Linked list using stack and also using recursion<br/>
23. You are given a node pointer to the singly linked list, you need to delete that node value, such that you don’t have access to its parent node and also that node is not a tail node<br/>
24. Merge two sorted singly linked list such that the final list is also sorted<br/>
25. You are given two singly linked lists that merge with each other at some node and become single linked lists. Find the merging point of both linked lists<br/>

29. Create Heap using Arrays and also Priority Queue<br/>
30. Verify if a tree is symmetric around its center i.e: left subtree = right subtree at every node.<br/>
31. Binary search algorithm<br/>
32. Find the maximum element in an array which is increasing and then decreasing<br/>
33. Maximum sum of k consecutive elements<br/>
34. Quicksort<br/>
35. Rotate matrix by 90 degree in clockwise<br/>
36. Matrix modify: Given an NXN matrix having binary values. For each 1 encountered, mark its whole row and column as 1.<br/>
37. Given an array A of N integers. Rearrange the array in non-decreasing order.<br/>
38. Given an array A of N integers, perform M operations on the array. Each of the M operations is of the form (i, j, k): from index i to j, increment all values by k. After M operations, produce the resultant array A<br/>
39. Given starting and end time of N meetings. One meeting room can be used for only one meeting at a time. Find the minimum number of rooms required to accomodate all the meetings. Starting and end time of a meeting cannot be same.<br/>
40. Ternany search<br/>
41. There is an array Arr of size N, the problem is to find pairs (i, j) such that it satisfies the below inequality:-  (Arr[i] | Arr[j]) – (Arr[i] & Arr[j]) = (Arr[i] – Arr[j]); Where “|” denotes bitwise OR and “&” denotes bitwise AND operators.<br/>
42. Jay and Veeru are trying to solve a problem. They have a lowercase english letter string. Jay is trying to take a multiple z small substring of the given string with x as start index and y as end index. He then tries to repeats each letter in the subsegment p times, where p is the index of the corresponding letter in the alphabet (a=1, b=2....., z=26). so if substring is "abc", Jay converts it to "abbccc". Veeru wants to know the length of the new string obtained by jay. Kindly help Veeru to find length of new string given by Jay<br/>
43. N queens Problem<br/>
44. Huffman decoding<br/>
